Intraweb + TinyMCE Sample, by Kelver Merlotti (kmerlotti@gmail.com)

This sample was created by Kelver Merlotti, to show IntraWeb integration with TinyMCE.
  
TinyMCE (Tiny Moxiecode Content Editor) is a platform-independent web-based JavaScript/HTML WYSIWYG editor control, released as open-source software under the LGPL by Ephox. More at http://www.tinymce.com.

Don't forget to take a look at the ExtraHeader form's property, where's the code to enable TinyMCE
